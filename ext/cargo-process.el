;;; Commentary:

;; Cargo Process Major mode.
;; Used to run Cargo background processes.
;; Current supported Cargo functions:
;;  * cargo-process-bench  - Run the benchmarks.
;;  * cargo-process-build  - Compile the current project.
;;  * cargo-process-clean  - Remove the target directory.
;;  * cargo-process-doc    - Build this project's and its dependencies' documentation.
;;  * cargo-process-new    - Create a new cargo project.
;;  * cargo-process-run    - Build and execute src/main.rs.
;;  * cargo-process-search - Search registry for crates.
;;  * cargo-process-test   - Run the tests.
;;  * cargo-process-update - Update dependencies listed in Cargo.lock.
;;  * cargo-process-repeat - Run the last cargo-process command.
